# Analysis and Insights:
### 1.	A total of 417,883 casualties were recorded, including 7,135 fatal cases and 59,312 serious cases.
### 2.	In the years 2021 and 2022, there were 222,146 and 195,737 total casualties, respectively. Analyzing trends between these two years provides valuable insights for targeted interventions.
### 3.	: Car accidents accounted for the highest number of casualties, contributing to approximately 79.8% of the total.
### 4.	Casualties were more prevalent in urban areas compared to rural areas.
### 5.	The majority of casualties occurred during daylight hours rather than at night.
### 6.	Identifying road types and surfaces associated with the highest casualties can assist authorities in prioritizing safety measures and road maintenance efforts effectively.

# Recommendations:
### Based on the insights derived from this analysis, we recommend the following actions:
### 1.	Launch awareness campaigns focused on car safety and responsible driving, given that car accidents were the leading cause of casualties.
### 2.	Implement road safety measures in urban areas, where casualties are more prevalent. These measures can include improved signage, traffic management, and pedestrian safety.
### 3.	Prioritize road safety initiatives during daylight hours, including enhanced visibility and law enforcement efforts.
### 4.	Allocate resources for the maintenance and improvement of high-risk road types and surfaces to reduce accidents.
### 5.	Establish a system for continuous data monitoring and analysis to identify emerging trends and adapt safety strategies accordingly.
